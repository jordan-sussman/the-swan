# The Swan - Lost Hatch Simulator

<p align="center"><img width="200" src="src/assets/swan.png"></p>

You and your partner are currently located in station three, or The Swan. The following protocol must be observed:

Every 108 minutes, the button must be pushed. From the moment the alarm sounds, you will have 4 minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor. When the alarm sounds, either you or your partner must input the code. It is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts. In this manner you will both stay as fresh and alert. It is of the utmost importance, that when the alarm sounds, the code be entered correctly and in a timely fashion. Until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands. On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso, and all of us at the DHARMA Initiative, thank you, namaste, and good luck.
